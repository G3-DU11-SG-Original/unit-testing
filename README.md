This is a simple guide on how to design unit testing more efficiently.

## ‚ú® Description
Testing for all types are important and very crucial during software development.
These knowledge are gather from around the internet and as well as personal experience.
It is important to know about the pros and cons between different conventions and technique in testing as a whole, because not every framework and language are the same!!!
The repo will have coding examples as well as theory about testing. 

!! Feels free to add your own knowledge, it is important to share knowledge between us devs !!

## Introduction of unit testing
The following content is written with Thomas Hamilton in mind, as this was based on the article that was very detailed
and easy to follow here [Unit Testing Tutorial ‚Äì What is, Types & Test Example](https://www.guru99.com/unit-testing-guide.html).

Please read it first if you want to read the original article.

What we simply do is adding more examples, code and explaining why some of the decisions is made during unit testing. 

Well, that's about enough of that. Let's gets started!!!

## Why unit test
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/Unit-Testing.png" align='center'>
There is different layers of testing before a source code is production ready. 
Testing is basically a way to future proofing any potential risk that we might encouters. And unit testing is that very first layer.

To sum up:
- Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.
- It helps the developers to understand the testing code base and enables them to make changes quickly
- Good unit tests serve as project documentation
- Unit tests help with code re-use. Migrate both your code and your tests to your new project. Tweak the code until the tests run again.
